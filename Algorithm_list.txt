In this file are listed all the available characters that can be used when
building a password for encoding/decoding. Any characters not presented in
this file will be ignored and treated as the 'a' character. The characters
that are followed by an asterisk (*) also accept a digit (0-9) right after
the character.

    a   ->  Character gets ignored
    b*  ->  Cycles the bits of the text (*) positions towards the left. If
            the digit is not present, defaults to 4.
    c   ->  Performs an exclusive OR (XOR) operation with the input and the
            password. If the password is shorter than the text, it repeats.
    d   ->  Performs a NOT operation on the bits of the input.
    e   ->  Reverses the bits of the input.
    f   ->  Reverses the characters of the input.
